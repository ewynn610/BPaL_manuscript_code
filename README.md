## Repository Contents

This repository includes code used to generate the analyses in the manuscript. The main scripts are described below:

- **`vst_calculation`**  
  Calculates VST-normalized expression data with batch correction using `limma::removeBatchEffect`.

- **`cfu_analysis`**  
  Scripts for visualization and statistical analysis of CFU over time across different drug treatment conditions.

- **`pca_analysis`**  
  Performs principal component analysis (PCA) and generates corresponding plots.

- **`de_analysis`**  
  Runs differential expression analyses and statistical tests comparing drug treatments and timepoints.

- **`clustering/heatmap_generation`**  
  Example code for generating heatmaps of average gene expression over time. Provided for bedaquiline (B); the same process was used for pretomanid (P), linezolid (L), and B vs. BPaL comparisons.

- **`gene_set_average_expression_analysis`**  
  Visualizes and tests for differences in average expression of predefined gene sets across treatment conditions.
